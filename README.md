CacheCow
========

An implementation of HTTP Caching in ASP.NET Web API for both client-side and server-side.

Please see [Wiki](https://github.com/aliostad/CacheCow/wiki)

#### NOTE
Currently CacheCow's attribute setting does not work with Attribute Routing. 
And I personally think [you should not use Attribute Routing](https://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Attribute%20routing%20in%20Web%20API)...
